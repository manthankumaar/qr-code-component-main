Reflecting on Learnings:

Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of how to:

Use flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and display to center content both horizontally and vertically within a container.
Apply background colors, borders, and box shadows to enhance the visual appearance of elements.
Create rounded corners for elements using the border-radius property.
Structure HTML content for better organization and readability, utilizing nested elements to create complex layouts.
Apply CSS styles to different components within the HTML structure to achieve a consistent and visually appealing design.
